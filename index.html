      <p class="description">Node Forward is a broad community led effort to solve problems facing Node and JavaScript through open collaboration.</p>
      <p>A lot of problems are facing us as a community. Node Forward is a place where the community can collaborate and take responsibility for those problems. This is how we can move forward.</p>
      <p class="header">Current Efforts</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/node-forward/welcome"><code>welcome</code></a> is building a better entry point for people new to Node and JavaScript.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/node-forward/build"><code>build</code></a> is creating better tools and infrastructure for building node and running tests.</p>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/node-forward/roadmap"><code>roadmap</code></a> is finding ways to gather feedback from the larger community about the direction of Node and JavaScript to inform those building Node and working on standards of the needs of the community.</p>
      <p>All other conversations, including those around possibly new Node Forward efforts are happening on <a href="https://github.com/node-forward/discussions/"><code>discussions</code></a>. One particularly interesting conversation is about better support for <a href="https://github.com/node-forward/discussions/issues/1">advanced mathematics</a>.</p>
      <p>There are also other community driven efforts you may be interested in. <a href="http://nodeschool.io/">NodeSchool</a> is a community building free educational workshops and running free and low-cost instructional meetups around the world. <a href="http://oneshot.nodeconf.com/">NodeConf ONE-SHOT</a> is a simple one day forkable conference anyone in the community can run in the world.</p>
